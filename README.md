## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

1. I only tested on macOS, if you are using Windows or Linux, you may need to find the bookmark file manually by input `arc://version` in the Arc address bar and find the bookmark data storage path by `Profile Path`"

2. I tested on 2025-02-02, Chrome/Safari seems only can import the first space. I won't spend too much time debugging for now. Because I tested that Firefox works normally, so you can do this:
   a. Import the exported Arc bookmarks into Firefox
   b. Export bookmarks through Firefox
   c. Import the bookmarks exported by Firefox into your browser

3. If you have a large number of bookmarks, it may cause the program to crash. Please try several times.
